## Jupiter's conclusion

Recommended for building static frontend sites. Blogs, Homepages, etc.

**About Gatsby**

It's a framework built on top of React. Specifically well at serving static pages. It's fast. As for development setup The boostrapping process is a breeze. Building your application and deployment are taken care of by Gatsby cloud (you can still publish to a host of your choice).

Customizing your Gatsby project is also very easy with plugins for adding typescript support, css modules, getting data from a CMS, and so forth.

The real power is that it comes by default with GraphQL which serves as the interface for all your data (local, cms, db, etc.).

**About the documentation format**

Documentation is begginner friendly, even with someone that do not have react/graphql knowledge. Concepts are explored and the steps are broken down in clean pieces.
